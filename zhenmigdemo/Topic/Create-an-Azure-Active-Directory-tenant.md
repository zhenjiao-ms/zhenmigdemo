# Create an Azure Active Directory tenant
---
Using the Power BI REST API, you can create a Power BI app in any platform that supports calling REST operations. However, before you get started creating a Power BI app, you need an **Azure Active Directory**, an organizational user, and a [Power BI service account](Sign-up-for-Power-BI-service.md).

## Create an Azure Active Directory tenant for a Power BI app

Power BI apps are integrated with **Azure Active Directory** (Azure AD) to provide secure sign in and authorization for your app. To integrate a Power BI app with Azure AD, you register the details about your application with Azure AD by using the Azure Management Portal.

**Important** To sign up for the **Power BI service**, your **Azure Active Directory** must have at least one organizational user. Use your organizational user to [sign up for the Power BI service](Sign-up-for-Power-BI-service.md).

### Add a user to your Azure Active Directory tenant
You use the user from your Azure AD to sign up for the **Power BI service**. Once you login to the **Power BI service** for the first time, youâ€™ll see the **Power BI service** added to your Azure AD which will allow you to create Power BI apps with the right permissions. Here's how to add a user to your Azure Active Directory:

 1. Navigate to https://manage.windowsazure.com and log in with the account that has an Azure subscription.
 2. Click **ACTIVE DIRECTORY** management icon in the left pane.
 3. Click **NEW** button at the bottom of the page.
 4. Choose **APP SERVICES** > **ACTIVE DIRECTORY** > **DIRECTORY** > **CUSTOM CREATE**.

    ![Add directory](../Image/NewDir.png)

 6. Choose OK icon. An Azure Active Directory is created.

### Add a user to your Azure Active Directory tenant
You need a user from your Azure AD to register an Azure AD app. Here's how to add a user to your **Azure Active Directory** tenant:

 1. In your **Azure Active Directory**, click **USERS**.

    ![Add user](../Image/AddADUser.png)

 2. At the bottom of the page, click **ADD USER**. A user account is used to register a Power BI app. 
 
 3. In the **Tell us about this user page**:
 
	1. For **TYPE OF USER**, choose **New user in you organization**.
	2. Enter your **USER NAME**.
	3. Click **Next**.
   
        ![enter image description here](../Image/AddUser2.png)

 4. In the **user profile** page, enter your **DISPLAY NAME**. Display name is a required field.

	![User Profile](../Image/UserProfile.png)

 5. Click **Next**. For **ROLE**, you can use **User**. 
 6. Click **Create** to create a temporary password. The new user is assigned a temporary password that must be changed on first sign in.
 7. In the **Get temporary password** page, copy the temporary password, and click **Complete** icon. You use the temporary password when you first login to your AAD.
 8. After you click the **Complete** icon, a new Azure AD user is created.

Once you have an **Azure Active Directory** tenant, and an organizational user, you need to sign up for Power BI.
