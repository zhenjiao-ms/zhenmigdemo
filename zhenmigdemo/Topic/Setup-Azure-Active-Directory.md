Using the Power BI REST API, you can create a Power BI app in any platform that supports calling REST operations. However, before you get started creating a Power BI app, you need an **Azure Active Directory**, an organizational user, and a [Power BI service](Sign-up-for-Power-BI-service.md) account.

##Create an Azure Active Directory tenant for a Power BI app

Power BI apps are integrated with **Azure Active Directory** (Azure AD) to provide secure sign in and authorization for your app. To integrate a Power BI app with Azure AD, you register the details about your application with Azure AD by using the Azure Management Portal.

**Important** To sign up for the **Power BI service**, your **Azure Active Directory** must have at least one organizational user. Use your organizational user to [sign up for the Power BI service](Sign-up-for-Power-BI-service.md).
