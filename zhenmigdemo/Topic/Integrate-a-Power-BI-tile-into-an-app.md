# Integrate a Power BI tile into an app
You integrate a Power BI tile into an app with an IFrame HTML element. For example, you can create a custom mobile app to display real-time Power BI tiles on the userâ€™s mobile device. Once you embed an IFrame into an app, you can add a click event handler so that the user can navigate to the dashboard.

The sample shows you how to:

- Get a Power BI tile from a dashboard
- Embed a Power BI tile into an app using an IFrame
- Navigate from a Power BI tile to the dashboard
