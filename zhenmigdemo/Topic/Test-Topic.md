CEP is a technology for high-throughput, low-latency processing of event streams. Typical event stream sources include data from manufacturing applications, financial trading applications, Web analytics, or operational analytics. The StreamInsight stream processing architecture and the familiar .NET-based development platform enable developers to quickly implement robust and highly efficient event processing applications to push data into a Power BI dashboard in real time.
